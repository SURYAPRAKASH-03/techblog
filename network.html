     <span><h2>PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN</h2></span>
 <p class="reveal">A public blockchain, also known as an open blockchain, is a type of blockchain network that is open to anyone and is permissionless, meaning that anyone can participate in the network without requiring prior approval or authorization. Public blockchains are characterized by the following key features:</p>

     <span><h3 class="reveal">Decentralization</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Public blockchains are distributed across a vast network of nodes (computers) operated by various individuals and organizations. There is no central authority or entity that controls the network.</p>
     
         <span><h3 class="reveal">Transparency</h3></span> <p class="reveal">All transactions and data on a public blockchain are transparent and accessible to anyone who wants to view them. This transparency helps build trust and accountability.</p>
     
             <span><h3 class="reveal">Immutability</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Once a transaction is added to a public blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or delete, ensuring the integrity and security of the historical record of transactions.</p>
     
                 <span><h3 class="reveal">Security</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Public blockchains use cryptographic techniques to secure data and transactions. They rely on consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate and secure transactions.</p>
     
                     <span><h3 class="reveal">Permissionless Access</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Participation on a public blockchain is open to anyone without requiring permission. Users can create transactions, validate blocks, and run nodes without restrictions.</p>
     
                         <span><h3 class="reveal">Censorship Resistance</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Public blockchains are designed to be resistant to censorship. Transactions cannot be easily blocked or censored by central authorities.</p>
     
                             <span><h3 class="reveal">Global Nature</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Public blockchains operate on a global scale, making them accessible to users from all over the world. They are not limited by geographical boundaries.</p>
     
                                 <span><h3 class="reveal">Native Cryptocurrency</h3></span> <p class="reveal">Many public blockchains have their native cryptocurrencies, which are used for various purposes within the network, such as paying transaction fees or participating in network governance.
 </p> 
     <p class="reveal">Examples of well-known public blockchains include:</p>
     
     <h4><a href="https://blockstream.info/" class="reveal">Bitcoin (BTC)</a></h4>
     
     <h4><a href=" https://etherscan.io/" class="reveal">Ethereum (ETH)</a> </h4>
     
     <h4><a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/ltc/" class="reveal">Litecoin</a> (LTC)</h4> 
     <span><h2 class="reveal">PRIVATE BLOCKCHAIN</h2></span>
     <p class="reveal">Private blockchains are restricted to a specific group of participants who are granted permission to access and validate transactions on the network. These networks are often used by organizations for internal purposes, such as supply chain management or record-keeping. Participants are known and trusted, making it more centralized compared to public blockchains.</p>
<span><h2 class="reveal">CONSORTIUM BLOCKCHINS</h2></span>    
 <p class="reveal">Consortium blockchains are a semi-private blockchain type where a group of organizations collaborates to maintain the network. Membership is limited to the consortium members, and these networks are often used for industry-specific applications, like trade finance or healthcare records.
 </p>
 <span><h2 class="reveal">PERMISSIONED BLOCKCHINS</h2></span> 
 <p class="reveal"> Permissioned blockchains require participants to obtain approval or permission to join and validate transactions on the network. They are more controlled and private than public blockchains but may involve multiple organizations or entities in the governance and operation.
 </p>
 <span><h2 class="reveal">HYBRID BLOCKCHINS</h2></span>
 <P class="reveal">Hybrid blockchains combine elements of both public and private blockchains. They allow for public participation in some aspects while maintaining a degree of privacy and control in other aspects. This type of blockchain is often used to strike a balance between transparency and confidentiality.
 </P>
 <span><h2 class="reveal">SIDECHINES BLOCKCHINS</h2></span> 
 <p class="reveal">Sidechains are separate blockchains that are connected to a primary blockchain, often a public one. They allow for the transfer of assets or data between the primary chain and the sidechain. This enables the development of specific applications or functionalities while benefiting from the security of the primary chain.
 </p>
 <span><h2 class="reveal">FEDERATED BLOCKCHINS</h2></span> 
 <p class="reveal">Federated blockchains involve a group of predefined, trusted nodes or validators that are responsible for confirming transactions and creating new blocks. This approach is used to achieve faster transaction processing and consensus while maintaining some level of decentralization.
 </p>
<span><h2 class="reveal">CROSS-CHAIN BLOCKCHINS</h2></span> 
 <p class="reveal">Cross-chain blockchains aim to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing assets or data to move seamlessly between them. This is essential for the growth of the blockchain ecosystem and the integration of multiple use cases.
 </p>
 <span><h2 class="reveal">PERMISSIONLESS BLOCKCHINS</h2></span>
 <p class="reveal">Permissionless blockchains are similar to public blockchains but often use Proof of Stake (PoS) or other consensus mechanisms that do not require extensive computational resources. They are open to anyone who wants to participate but may require a stake of cryptocurrency to become a validator.
